In the course of HSS401 - Soft skills and Personality development under the guide of Prof. T. RaviChandran.
In this course, I have developed self-awareness, self-confidence, presentation skills, telephone communication skills, how to overcome failures and time management skills.

Here for each week, I have written a Activity Logs in which it contain what I have learnt for that week.
